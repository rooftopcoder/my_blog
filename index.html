                <h2>What is App Academy Open?</h2>
                <p>With App Academy Open you’ll get free access to App Academy’s entire 24 Week Online Software Engineering Program curriculum (that's over 500 hours of material!), which has placed thousands of people in software development jobs.</p>
                <h3>500 hours of full-stack online curriculum</h3>
                <p>This is the same curriculum taught in our 24 Week Online Software Engineering Program. You’ll learn everything full-stack from JavaScript to Python, and more.</p>
                <h3>Guidance on setting up your own coding environment</h3>
                <p>Don’t struggle for hours with setting up a coding environment. In one of the very first modules, we walk you through, step-by-step, exactly how to do just that.</p>
                <h3>A progress-oriented user interface and experience</h3>
                <p>The curriculum is organized in topic-based modules, with estimated completion times and progress bars for each lesson. So you won't lose track of where you left off.</p>

                    <h3>Why I join this programme</h3>
                    <p>App Academy Open is the best free resource to learn to code online. If you're unsure about attending a coding bootcamp like App Academy, try out Open and see if it's for you!</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><h4>What's the difference between Open and App Academy's 24 Week Online Software Engineering Program (Full Time)?</h4> The curriculum on Open is the same as our 24 Week Online Software Engineering Program (Full Time), but since Open is self directed and self-paced, there are inherent differences. Our 24 Week Online Software Engineering Program provides you with a structured schedule, access to virtual lectures and instruction, pair programming, assessments, job search support, and access to our alumni network. Access to these components typically is the difference between completing the course in 24 weeks (full time) versus 12 months (at 10 hours/week). </li>
                        <li><h4>What if I want help from App Academy instructors, but can't enroll in the 24 Week Online Software Engineering Program (Full Time)? </h4> No problem! App Academy also offers a Part Time Online Software Engineering Program that provides instructor lead classes and support, but offers more schedule flexibility.</li>
